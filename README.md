# SecretHitlerTest
This is a test of creating a game like Secret Hitler. Of course, here I'm not focused on the UI or UX much since I'm more focused on understanding web sockets and how to use them as well as SQL for messaging, and how to combine them with OOP to generally create an online multiplayer game.
